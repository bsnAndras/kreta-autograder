# Kréta Autograder

### A Chrome Extension that enhances the functionality of the Kréta online administration system, improving workflow efficiency and user experience.

This Chrome Extension builds upon the existing Kréta user interface through JavaScript DOM manipulation. Its primary purpose is to automate the tedious task of assigning identical text grades to large classes, significantly accelerating what was previously a time-consuming process.

The extension works by programmatically interacting with the interface, clicking appropriate buttons on behalf of the user, which dramatically increases efficiency.
